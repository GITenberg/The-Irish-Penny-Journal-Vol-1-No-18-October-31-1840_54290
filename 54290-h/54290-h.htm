<h2>WOODLANDS, COUNTY OF DUBLIN</h2>

<p>Woodlands, the seat of one of our good resident landlords,
Colonel White, considered in connection with its beautiful demesne,
may justly rank as the finest aristocratic residence in
the immediate vicinity of our metropolis. As an architectural
composition, indeed, the house, or castle, as it is called,
will not bear a comparison, either for its classical correctness
of details, or its general picturesqueness of outline, with the
Castle of Clontarf&mdash;the architectural gem of our vicinity; but
its proportions are on a grander scale, and its general effect
accordingly more imposing, while its demesne scenery, in its
natural beauties, the richness of its plantations, and other artificial
improvements, is without a rival in our metropolitan
county, and indeed is characterised by some features of such
exquisite beauty as are very rarely found in park scenery any
where, and which are nowhere to be surpassed. Well might
the Prince Pückler Muskau, who despite of his strange name
has undoubtedly a true taste for the beautiful and picturesque,
describe the entrance to this demesne as “indeed the most
delightful in its kind that can be imagined.” “Scenery,” he
continues, “by nature most beautiful, is improved by art to
the highest degree of its capability, and, without destroying
its free and wild character, a variety and richness of vegetation
is produced which enchants the eye. Gay shrubs and
wild flowers, the softest turf and giant trees, festooned with
creeping plants, fill the narrow glen through which the path
winds, by the side of the clear dancing brook, which, falling
in little cataracts, flows on, sometimes hidden in the thicket,
sometimes resting like liquid silver in an emerald cup, or
rushing under overhanging arches of rock, which nature seems
to have hung there as triumphal gates for the beneficent Naïad
of the valley to pass through.”</p>

<p>This description may appear somewhat enthusiastic, but we
can truly state as our own opinion, formed on a recent visit
to Woodlands, that it is by no means overdrawn, but, on the
contrary, that it would be equally difficult, if not impossible,
either for the pencil or the pen to convey an adequate idea of
the peculiar beauties of this little tract of fairy land.</p>

<p>Singularly beautiful, however, as this sylvan glen unquestionably
is, it is only one of the many features for which
Woodlands is pre-eminently distinguished. Its finely undulating
surface&mdash;its sheets of water, though artificially formed&mdash;its
noble forest timber&mdash;but above all, its woodland walks,
commanding vistas of the exquisite valley of the Liffey, with
the more remote scenery bounded by the Dublin and Wicklow
mountains&mdash;all are equally striking, and present a combination
of varied and impressive features but rarely found within
the bounds of even a princely demesne.</p>

<p>Though Woodlands derives very many of its attractions
from modern improvements, its chief artificial features are of
no recent creation, and are such as it would require a century
or two to bring to their present perfection. Woodlands is
emphatically an old place, and is said to have been granted
by King John to Sir Geoffry Lutterel, an Anglo-Norman
knight who accompanied him into Ireland, and in possession
of whose descendants it remained, and was their residence
from the close of the fifteenth till the commencement of the
present century, when it was sold to Mr Luke White by the
last Earl of Carhampton. Up to this period it was known by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
the name of Lutterelstown, a name which, for various reasons,
the family into whose possession it has passed have
wisely changed.</p>

<p>The principal parts of the mansion were rebuilt about fifty
years back. But a portion of the original castle still remains,
and an apartment in it bears the name of King John’s chamber.
It has also received additional extension from its present
proprietor, who is now making further additions to the
structure.</p>

<p>Woodlands is situated on the north bank of the Liffey,
about five miles from Dublin.</p>

<h2 class="gap4">PEGGY THE PISHOGUE.</h2>

<p>“And now, Mickey Brennan, it’s not but I have a grate
regard for you, for troth you’re a dacint boy, and a dacint
father and mother’s child; but you see, avick, the short and
the long of it is, that you needn’t be looking after my little
girl any more.”</p>

<p>Such was the conclusion of a long and interesting harangue
pronounced by old Brian Moran of Lagh-buoy, for the purpose
of persuading his daughter’s sweetheart to waive his pretensions&mdash;a
piece of diplomacy never very easy to effect, but doubly
difficult when the couple so unceremoniously separated have
laboured under the delusion that they were born for each
other, as was the ease in the affair of which our story tells;
and certainly, whatever Mr Michael Brennan’s other merits
may have been, he was very far from exhibiting himself as a
pattern of patience on the occasion.</p>

<p>“Why, thin, Brian Moran!” he outrageously exclaimed,
“in the name of all that’s out of the way, will you give me
one reason, good, bad, or indifferent, and I’ll be satisfied?”</p>

<p>“Och, you unfortunate gossoon, don’t be afther axing me,”
responded Brian dolefully.</p>

<p>“Ah, thin, why wouldn’t I?” replied the rejected lover.
“Aren’t we playing together since she could walk&mdash;wasn’t
she the light of my eyes and the pulse of my heart these six
long years&mdash;and when did one of ye ever either say or sign
that I was to give over until this blessed minute?&mdash;tell me
that.”</p>

<p>“Widdy Eelish!” groaned the closely interrogated parent;
“’tis true enough for you. Botheration to Peggy, I wish she
tould you herself. I knew how it ’ud be; an’ sure small
blame to you; an’ it’ll kill Meny out an’ out.”</p>

<p>“Is it that I amn’t rich enough?” he asked impetuously.</p>

<p>“No, avich machree, it isn’t; but, sure, can’t you wait an’
ax Peggy.”</p>

<p>“Is it because there’s any thing against me?” continued
he, without heeding this reference to the mother of his fair
one&mdash;“Is it because there’s any thing against me, I say, now
or evermore, in the shape of warrant, or summons, or bad
word, or any thing of the kind?”</p>

<p>“Och, <i lang="ga">forrear, forrear</i>!” answered poor Brian, “but can’t
you ax Peggy!” and he clasped his hands again and again
with bitterness, for the young man’s interest had been, from
long and constant habit, so interwoven in his mind with those
of his darling Meny, that he was utterly unable to check the
burst of agony which the question had excited. The old man’s
evident grief and evasion of the question were not lost upon his
companion.</p>

<p>“I’m belied&mdash;I know I am&mdash;I have it all now,” shouted he,
utterly losing all command of himself. “Come, Brian Moran,
this is no child’s play&mdash;tell me at once who dared to spake one
word against me, an’ if I don’t drive the lie down his throat,
be it man, woman, or child, I’m willing to lose her and every
thing else I care for!”</p>

<p>“No, then,” answered Brian, “the never a one said a
word against you&mdash;you never left it in their power, avich;
an’ that’s what’s breaking my heart. Millia murther, it’s all
Peggy’s own doings.”</p>

<p>“What!” he replied&mdash;“I’ll be bound Peggy had a bad
dhrame about the match. Arrah, out with it, an’ let us hear
what Peggy the Pishogue has to say for herself&mdash;out with it,
man; I’m asthray for something to laugh at.”</p>

<p>“Oh, whisht, whisht&mdash;don’t talk that way of Peggy any
how,” exclaimed Brian, offended by this imputation on the
unerring wisdom of his helpmate. “Whatever she says,
doesn’t it come to pass? Didn’t it rain on Saturday last, fine
as the day looked? Didn’t Tim Higgins’s cow die? Wasn’t
Judy Carney married to Tom Knox afther all? Ay, an’ as
sure as your name is Mickey Brennan, what she says will
come true of yourself too. <i lang="ga">Forrear, forrear!</i> that the like
should befall one of your dacint kin!”</p>

<p>“Why, what’s going to happen me?” inquired he, his voice
trembling a little in spite of all his assumed carelessness: for
contemptuously as he had alluded to the wisdom of his intended
mother-in-law, it stood in too high repute not to create
in him some dismay at the probability of his figuring unfavourably
in any of her prognostications.</p>

<p>“Don’t ax me, don’t ax me,” was the sorrowing answer;
“but take your haste out of the stable at once, and go
straight to Father Coffey; and who knows but he might put
you on some way to escape the bad luck that’s afore you.”</p>

<p>“Psha! fudge! ’pon my sowl it’s a shame for you, Brian
Moran.”</p>

<p>“Divil a word of lie in it,” insisted Brian; “Peggy found it
all out last night; an’ troth it’s troubling her as much as if
you were her own flesh and blood. More betoken, haven’t you
a mole there under your ear?”</p>

<p>“Well, and what if I have?” rejoined he peevishly, but
alarmed all the while by the undisguised pity which his future
lot seemed to call forth. “What if I have?&mdash;hadn’t many a
man the same afore me?”</p>

<p>“No doubt, Mickey, agra, and the same bad luck came to
them too,” replied Brian. “Och, you unfortunate ignorant
crathur, sure you wouldn’t have me marry my poor little girl
to a man that’s sooner or later to end his days on the gallows!”</p>

<p>“The gallows!” he slowly exclaimed. “Holy Virgin! is that
what’s to become of me after all?” He tried to utter a laugh of
derision and defiance, but it would not do; such a vaticination
from such a quarter was no laughing matter. So yielding at last
to the terror which he had so vainly affected to combat, he
buried his face in his hands, and threw himself violently on
the ground; while Brian, scarcely less moved by the revelation
he had made on the faith of his wife’s far-famed sagacity,
seated himself compassionately beside him to administer what
consolation he could.</p>

<p>Mickey Brennan, in the parlance of our country, was a snug
gossoon, well to do in the world, had a nice bit of land, a comfortable
house, good crops, a pig or two, a cow or two, a
sheep or two, a handsome good-humoured face, a good character;
and, what made him more marriageable than all the
rest, he had the aforementioned goods all to himself, for his
father and mother were dead, and his last sister had got married
at Shrove-tide. With all these combined advantages he
might have selected any girl in the parish; but his choice
was made long years before: it was Meny Moran or nobody&mdash;a
choice in which Meny Moran herself perfectly concurred,
and which her father, good, easy, soft-hearted Brian, never
thought of disputing, although he was able to give her a fortune
probably amounting to double what her suitor was
worth. But was the fair one’s mother ever satisfied when such
a disparity existed? Careful creatures! pound for pound is
the maternal maxim in all ages and countries, and to give
Peggy Moran her due, she was as much influenced by it as
her betters, and murmured loud and long at the acquiescence of
her husband in such a sacrifice. She murmured in vain, however:
much as Brian deferred to her judgment and advice in
all other matters, his love for his fond and pretty Meny armed
him with resolution in this. When she wept at her mother’s
insinuations, he always found a word of comfort for her; and
if words wouldn’t do, he managed to bring Mickey and her
together, and left them to settle the matter after their own
way&mdash;a method which seldom failed of success. But Peggy
was not to be baulked of her will. What! she whose mere
word could make or break any match for five miles round, to
be forbidden all interference in her own daughter’s: it was
not to be borne. So at last she applied herself in downright
earnest to the task. She dreamed at the match, tossed cups at
it, saw signs at it: in fine, called her whole armoury of necromancy
into requisition, and was rewarded at last by the discovery
that the too highly-favoured swain was inevitably destined to
end his days on the gallows&mdash;a discovery which, as has been
already seen, fulfilled her most sanguine wishes.</p>

<p>Whatever may be the opinion of other and wiser people on
the subject, in the parish of Ballycoursey or its vicinity it was
rather an ugly joke to be thus devoted to the infernal gods by
a prophetess of such unerring sagacity as Peggy Moran, or,
as she was sometimes styled with reference to her skill in all
supernatural matters, Peggy the Pishogue&mdash;that cognomen
implying an acquaintance with more things in heaven and
earth than are dreamt of in philosophy; and most unquestionably
it was no misnomer: the priest himself was not more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
deeply read in his breviary than was she in all the signs and
omens whereby the affairs of this moving world are shadowed
and foretokened&mdash;nothing was too great or too small for her
all-piercing ken&mdash;in every form of augury she was omniscient,
from cup-tossing up to necromancy&mdash;in vain the mystic dregs
of the tea-cup assumed shapes that would have puzzled Doctor
Wall himself: with her first glance she detected at once the
true meaning of the hieroglyphic symbol, and therefrom dealt
out deaths, births, and marriages, with the infallibility of a
newspaper&mdash;in vain Destiny, unwilling to be unrolled, shrouded
itself in some dream that would have bothered King Solomon.
Peggy no sooner heard it than it was unravelled&mdash;there was
not a ghost in the country with whose haunts and habits she
was not as well acquainted as if she was one of the fraternity&mdash;not
a fairy could put his nose out without being detected by
her&mdash;the value of property was increased tenfold all round the
country by the skill with which she wielded her charms and
spells for the discovery of all manner of theft. But I must
stop; for were I to recount but half her powers, the eulogium
would require a <cite>Penny Journal</cite> for itself, and still leave matter
for a supplement. It would be a melancholy instance indeed
of Irish ingratitude if for all these superhuman exertions she
was not rewarded by universal confidence. To the credit of
the parish be it said that no such stigma was attached to it:
nothing could equal the estimation in which all her words and
actions were held by her neighbours&mdash;nothing but the estimation
in which they were held in her own household by her
husband and daughter.</p>

<p>Such being the gifted personage who had foretold the coming
disasters of Mickey Brennan, it is not to be wondered at
that the matter created a sensation, particularly as sundry
old hags to whom she had imparted her discovery were requested
to hush it up for the poor gossoon’s sake. His friends
sorrowed over him as a gone man, for not the most sceptical
among them ventured to hazard even a doubt of Peggy’s veracity&mdash;in
fact, they viewed the whole as a matter requiring
consolation and sympathy rather than as a scrutiny into the
sources of her information, which by common consent were
viewed as indubitable, while some, more compassionate than
the rest, went so far as to declare “that since the thing could
not be avoided, and Mickey, poor fellow, must be hanged, they
hoped it might be for something dacint, not robbing, or coining,
or the like.”</p>

<p>The hardest task of all is to describe the feelings of poor
Brennan himself on the occasion; for much as he had affected
to disparage the sybilline revelations of the wierd woman of
Ballycoursey, there was not one in the neighbourhood who was
more disposed to yield them unlimited credence in any case
but his own; and even in his own case he was not long enabled
to struggle against conviction. Let people prate as they may
about education and its effects, it will require a period of
more generations than one to root the love of the marvellous
out of the hearts of our countrymen; and until that be effected,
every village in the land will have its wise woman, and with
nine-tenths of her neighbours what she says will be regarded
as gospel. Some people of course will laugh to scorn such an
assertion, and more will very respectfully beg leave to doubt
it, but still it is true; and in the more retired inland villages
circumstances are every day occurring far more extravagant
than anything detailed in this story, as is very well known to
all who are much conversant with such places. But to return
to the doomed man:&mdash;How could he be expected to bear up
against this terrible denunciation, when all the consolation he
could receive from his nearest and dearest was that “it was a
good man’s death?” Death! poor fellow, he had suffered the
pains of a thousand deaths already, in living without the hope
of ever being the husband of his Meny. Death, instant and
immediate, would have been a relief to him; and it was not
long until, by his anxiety to obtain that relief, he afforded an
opportunity to Peggy of displaying her own reliance on the
correctness of her prognostications. Goaded into madness by
his present sufferings and his fears for the future, he made an
attempt upon his life by plunging into an adjacent lake when
no one, as he thought, was near to interrupt his intentions.
It was not so, however&mdash;a shepherd had observed him, but at
such a distance that before help could be obtained to rescue
him he was to all appearance lifeless. The news flew like
wildfire: he was dead, stone dead, they said&mdash;had lain in the
water ten minutes, half an hour, half the day, since last night;
but in one point they all concurred&mdash;dead he was; dead as St
Dominick.</p>

<p>“Troth he’s not,” was Peggy’s cool rejoinder. “Be quiet,
and I’ll engage he’ll come to. <i lang="ga">Nabocklish</i>, he that’s born to
be hanged will never be drowned. Wait a while an’ hould
your tongues. <i lang="ga">Nabocklish</i>, I tell you he’ll live to spoil a
market yet, an’ more’s the pity.”</p>

<p>People shook their heads, and almost began to think their
wise woman had made a mistake, and read hemp instead of
water. It was no such thing, however: slowly and beyond
all hopes, Brennan recovered the effects of his rash attempt,
thereby fulfilling so much of his declared destiny, and raising
the reputation of Mrs Moran to a point that she never had
attained before. That very week she discovered no less than
six cases of stolen goods, twice detected the good people taking
unauthorised liberties with their neighbours’ churns, and
spaed a score of fortunes, at the very least; and he, poor fellow,
satisfied at last that Fortune was not to be bilked so
easily, resigned himself to his fate like a man, and began to
look about him in earnest for some opportunity of gracing the
gallows without disgracing his people.</p>

<p>And Meny&mdash;poor heart-stricken Meny&mdash;loving as none but
the true and simple-minded can love, the extent of her grief
was such as the true and simple-minded only can know; and
yet there was worse in store for her. Shortly after this consummation
of her mother’s fame, a whisper began to creep
through the village&mdash;a whisper of dire import, portending
death and disaster on some luckless wight unknown&mdash;“Peggy
Moran has something on her mind.” What could it be? Silent
and mysterious she shook her head when any one ventured
to question her&mdash;the pipe was never out of her jaw unless when
she slept or sat down to her meals&mdash;she became as cross as a
cat, which to do her justice was not her wont, and eschewed
all sorts of conversation, which most assuredly was not her
wont either. The interest and curiosity of her neighbours was
raised to a most agonising pitch&mdash;every one trembled lest the
result should be some terrible revelation affecting himself or
herself, as the case might be: it was the burden of the first
question asked in the morning, the last at night. Every word
she uttered during the day was matter of speculation to an
hundred anxious inquirers; and there was every danger of
the good people of Ballycoursey going absolutely mad with
fright if they were kept any longer in the dark on the subject.</p>

<p>At length there was a discovery; but, as is usually the case
in all scrutinies into forbidden matters, it was at the cost of
the too-daring investigator. Peggy and Brian were sitting
one night before the fire, preparing for their retirement, when
a notion seized the latter to probe the sorrows of his helpmate.</p>

<p>“’Deed it well becomes you to ax,” quoth the wierd woman
in answer to his many and urgent inquiries; “for Brian,
achorra machree, my poor ould man, there’s no use in hiding
it&mdash;it’s all about yourself.”</p>

<p>“No, then!” exclaimed the surprised interrogator; “the
Lord betune us an’ harm, is it?”</p>

<p>“’Deed yes, Brian,” responded the sybil with a melancholy
tone, out of the cloud of smoke in which she had sought to
hide her troubles. “I’m thinking these last few days you’re
not yourself at all at all.”</p>

<p>“Tare an ounties! maybe I’m not,” responded he of the
doubtful identity.</p>

<p>“Do you feel nothing on your heart, Brian achree?”</p>

<p>“I do; sure enough I do,” gasped poor Brian, ready to believe
anything of himself.</p>

<p>“Something like a <em>plurrisy</em>, isn’t it?” inquired the mourner.</p>

<p>“Ay, sure enough, like a plurrisy for all the world, Lord
betune us an’ harm!”</p>

<p>“An’ you do be very cold, I’ll engage, these nights, Brian?”
continued she.</p>

<p>“Widdy Eelish! I’m as could as ice this minute,” answered
Brian, and his teeth began to chatter as if he was up
to his neck in a mill-pond.</p>

<p>“An’ your appetite is gone entirely, achra?” continued his
tormentor.</p>

<p>“Sorra a word o’ lie in it,” answered the newly discovered
invalid, forgetful however that he had just finished discussing
a skib of potatoes and a mug of milk for his supper.</p>

<p>“And the cat, the crathur, looked at you this very night
after licking her paw.”</p>

<p>“I’ll engage she did. Bad luck to her,” responded Brian,
“I wouldn’t put it beyant her.”</p>

<p>“Let me feel your pulse, asthore,” said Peggy in conclusion;
and Brian submitted his trembling wrist to her inspection,
anxiously peering into her face all the while to read his
doom therein. A long and deep sigh broke from her lips,
along with a most voluminous puff of smoke, as she let the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
limb drop from her hold, and commenced rocking herself to
and fro, uttering a low and peculiar species of moan, which
to her terrified patient sounded as a death summons.</p>

<p>“Murther-an’-ages, Peggy, sure it’s not going to die I am!”
exclaimed Brian.</p>

<p>“Och, widdy! widdy!” roared the afflicted spouse, now
giving full vent to her anguish, “it’s little I thought, Brian
asthore machree, when I married you in your beauty and your
prime, that I’d ever live to cry the keen over you&mdash;ochone,
ochone! ’tis you was the good ould man in airnest&mdash;och! och!”</p>

<p>“Arrah, Peggy!” interposed the object of her rather premature
lamentations.</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t talk to me&mdash;don’t talk to me. I’ll never hould
up my head again, so I won’t!” continued the widow that was
to be, in a tone that quickly brought all the house about her,
and finally all the neighbours. Great was the uproar that ensued,
and noisy the explanations, which, however, afforded no
small relief to the minds of all persons not immediately concerned
in the welfare of the doomed Brian. Peggy was inconsolable
at the prospect of such a bereavement. Meny clung
in despair to the poor tottering old man, her grief too deep
for lamentation, while he hobbled over his prayers as fast and
as correctly as his utter dismay would permit him. Next
morning he was unable to rise, refused all nourishment, and
called vehemently for the priest. Every hour he became
worse; he was out of one faint into another; announced symptoms
of every complaint that ever vexed mankind, and declared
himself affected by a pain in every member, from his toe to his
cranium. No wonder it was a case to puzzle the doctor.
The man of science could make nothing of it&mdash;swore it was the
oddest complication of diseases that ever he had heard of&mdash;and
strongly recommended that the patient be tossed in a blanket,
and his wife treated to a taste of the horse-pond. Father
Coffey was equally nonplussed.</p>

<p>“What ails you, Brian?”</p>

<p>“An all-overness of some kind or other, your reverence,”
groaned the sufferer in reply, and the priest had to own himself
a bothered man. Nothing would induce him to rise&mdash;“where’s
the use in a man’s gettin’ up, an’ he goin’ to die?”
was his answer to those who endeavoured to rouse him&mdash;“isn’t
it a dale dacinter to die in bed like a Christian?”</p>

<p>“God’s good!&mdash;maybe you won’t die this time, Brian.”</p>

<p>“Arrah, don’t be talking&mdash;doesn’t Peggy know best?”
And with this undeniable assertion he closed all his arguments,
receiving consolation from none, not even his heart-broken
Meny. Despite of all his entreaties to be let die in peace, the
doctor, who guessed how matters stood, was determined to
try the effects of a blister, and accordingly applied one of
more than ordinary strength, stoutly affirming that it would
have the effect of the patient being up and walking on the
morrow. A good many people had gathered into his cabin
to witness the cure, as they always do when their presence
could be best dispensed with; and to these Peggy, with tears
and moans, was declaring her despair in all remedies whatever,
and her firm conviction that a widow she’d be before
Sunday, when Brian, roused a little by the uneasy stimulant
from the lethargy into which they all believed him to be sunk,
faintly expressed his wish to be heard.</p>

<p>“Peggy, agra,” said he, “there’s no denyin’ but you’re a
wonderful woman entirely; an’ since I’m goin’, it would be a
grate consolation to me if you’d tell us all now you found out
the sickness was on me afore I knew it myself. It’s just curiosity,
agra&mdash;I wouldn’t like to die, you see, without knowin’
for why an’ for what&mdash;it ’ud have a foolish look if any body
axed me what I died of, an’ me not able to tell them.”</p>

<p>Peggy declared her willingness to do him this last favour,
and, interrupted by an occasional sob, thus proceeded:&mdash;</p>

<p>“It was Thursday night week&mdash;troth I’ll never forget that
night, Brian asthore, if I live to be as ould as Noah&mdash;an’ it
was just after my first sleep that I fell draiming. I thought
I went down to Dan Keefe’s to buy a taste ov mate, for ye all
know he killed a <i lang="ga">bullsheen</i> that day for the market ov Moneen;
an’ I thought when I went into his house, what did I
see hangin’ up but an ugly <em>lane</em> carcase, an’ not a bit too fresh
neither, an’ a strange man dividin’ it with a hatchet; an’ says
he to me with a mighty grum look,</p>

<p>“‘Well, honest woman, what do you want?&mdash;is it to buy
bullsheen?’</p>

<p>“‘Yes,’ says I, ‘but not the likes of that&mdash;it’s not what
we’re used to.’</p>

<p>“‘Divil may care,’ says he; ‘I’ll make bould to cut out a
rib for you.’</p>

<p>“‘Oh, don’t if you plase,’ says I, puttin’ out my hand to
stop him; an’ with that what does he do but he lifts the
hatchet an’ makes a blow at my hand, an’ cuts the weddin’
ring in two on my finger?”</p>

<p>“Dth! dth! dth!” was ejaculated on all sides by her
wondering auditory, for the application of the dream to Brian
was conclusive, according to the popular method of explaining
such matters. They looked round to see how he sustained
the brunt of such a fatal revelation. There he was sitting
bolt upright in the bed, notwithstanding his unpleasant incumbrance,
his mouth and eyes wide open.</p>

<p>“Why, thin, blur-an’-ages, Peggy Moran,” he slowly exclaimed,
when he and they had recovered a little from their
surprise, “do you mane to tell me that’s all that ailed me?”</p>

<p>Peggy and her coterie started back as he uttered this extraordinary
inquiry, there being something in his look that
portended his intention to leap out of bed, and probably display
his indignation a little too forcibly, for, quiet as he was,
his temper wasn’t proof against a blister; but his bodily
strength failed him in the attempt, and, roaring with pain, he
resumed his recumbent position. But Peggy’s empire was
over&mdash;the blister had done its business, and in a few days he
was able to stump about as usual, threatening to inflict all
sorts of punishments upon any one who dared to laugh at him.
A laugh is a thing, however, not easy to be controlled, and
finally poor Brian’s excellent temper was soured to such a
degree by the ridicule which he encountered, that he determined
to seek a reconciliation with young Brennan, pitch the
decrees of fate to Old Nick, and give Father Coffey a job
with the young couple.</p>

<p>To this resolution we are happy to say he adhered: still
happier are we to say, that among the county records we have
not yet met the name of his son-in-law, and that unless good
behaviour and industry be declared crimes worthy of bringing
their perpetrator to the gallows, there is very little chance
indeed of Mickey Brennan fulfilling the prophecy of Peggy
the Pishogue.</p>

<h2 class="gap4">A SHORT CHAPTER ON BUSTLES.</h2>

<p>Bustles!&mdash;what are bustles? Ay, reader, fair reader, you
may well ask that question. But some of your sex at least
know the meaning of the word, and the use of the article it
designates, sufficiently well, though, thank heaven! there are
many thousands of my countrywomen who are as yet ignorant
of both, and indeed to whom such knowledge would be quite
useless. Would that I were in equally innocent ignorance!
Not, reader, that I am of the feminine gender, and use the
article in question; but my knowledge of its mysterious uses,
and the various materials of which it is composed, has been
the ruin of me. I will have inscribed on my tomb, “Here
lies a man who was killed by a bustle!”</p>

<p>But before I detail the circumstances of my unhappy fate, it
will perhaps be proper to give a description of the article itself
which has been the cause of my undoing. Well, then, a
bustle is…</p>

<p>But the editor will perhaps object to this description as
being too distinct and graphic. If so, then here goes for another
less laboured and more characteristically mysterious.</p>

<p>A bustle is an article used by ladies to take from their form
the character of the Venus of the Greeks, and impart to it
that of the Venus of the Hottentots!</p>

<p>That ladies should have a taste so singular, may appear incredible;
but there is no accounting for tastes, and I know to
my cost that the fact is indisputable.</p>

<p>I made the discovery a few years since, and up to that time
I had always borne the character of a sage, sedate, and promising
young man&mdash;one likely to get on in the world by my
exertions, and therefore sure to be helped by my friends. I
was even, I flatter myself, a favourite with the fair sex too; and
justly so, for I was their most ardent admirer; and there was
one most lovely creature among them whom I had fondly
hoped to have made my own. But, alas! how vain and visionary
are our hopes of human happiness: such hopes with me
have fled for ever! As I said before, I am a ruined man, and
all in consequence of ladies’ bustles.</p>

<p>In an unlucky hour I was in a ball-room, seated at a little
distance from my fair one&mdash;my eyes watching her every air
and look, my ears catching every sound of her sweet voice&mdash;when
I heard her complain to a female friend, in tones of the
softest whispering music, that she was oppressed with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
heat of the place. “My dear,” her friend replied, “it must
be the effect of your bustle. What do you stuff it with?”
“Hair&mdash;horse-hair,” was the reply. “Hair!&mdash;mercy on us!”
says her friend, “it is no wonder you are oppressed&mdash;that’s a
<em>hot-and-hot</em> material truly. Why, you should do as I do&mdash;you
do not see me fainting; and the reason is, that I stuff my
bustle with hay&mdash;new hay!”</p>

<p>I heard no more, for the ladies, supposing from my eyes that
I was a listener, changed the topic of conversation, though
indeed it was not necessary, for at the time I had not the
slightest notion of what they meant. Time, however, passed
on most favourably to my wishes&mdash;another month, and I should
have called my Catherine my own. She was on a visit to my
sister, and I had every opportunity to make myself agreeable.
We sang together, we talked together, and we danced together.
All this would have been very well, but unfortunately
we also walked together. It was on the last time we ever did
so that the circumstance occurred which I have now to relate,
and which gave the first death-blow to my hopes of happiness.
We were crossing Carlisle-bridge, her dear arm linked
in mine, when we chanced to meet a female friend; and wishing
to have a little chat with her without incommoding the
passengers, we got to the edge of the flag-way, near which at
the time there was standing an old white horse, totally blind.
He was a quiet-looking animal, and none of us could have supposed
from his physiognomy that he had any savage propensity
in his nature. But imagine my astonishment and horror
when I suddenly heard my charmer give a scream that pierced
me to the very heart!&mdash;and when I perceived that this atrocious
old blind brute, having slowly and slyly swayed his head
round, caught the&mdash;how shall I describe it?&mdash;caught my Catherine&mdash;really
I can’t say how&mdash;but he caught her; and before
I could extricate her from his jaws, he made a reef in
her garments such as lady never suffered. Silk gown, petticoat,
bustle&mdash;everything, in fact, gave way, and left an opening&mdash;a
chasm&mdash;an exposure, that may perhaps be imagined,
but cannot be described.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>As rapidly as I could, of course, I got my fair one into a
jarvy, and hurried home, the truth gradually opening in my
mind as to the cause of the disaster&mdash;it was, that the blind
horse, hungry brute, had been attracted by the smell of my
Catherine’s bustle, made of hay&mdash;new hay!</p>

<p>Catherine was never the same to me afterwards&mdash;she took
the most invincible dislike to walk with me, or rather, perhaps,
to be seen in the streets with me. But matters were not
yet come to the worst, and I had indulged in hopes that she
would yet be mine. I had however taken a deep aversion to
bustles, and even determined to wage war upon them to the
best of my ability. In this spirit, a few days after, I determined
to wreak my vengeance on my sister’s bustle, for I
found by this time that she too was emulous of being a Hottentot
beauty. Accordingly, having to accompany her and
my intended wife to a ball, I stole into my sister’s room in the
course of the evening before she went into it to dress, and
pouncing upon her hated bustle, which lay on her toilet table,
I inflicted a cut on it with my penknife, and retired. But
what a mistake did I make! Alas, it was not my sister’s
bustle, but my Catherine’s! However, we went to the ball,
and for a time all went smoothly on. I took out my Catherine
as a partner in the dance; but imagine my horror when
I perceived her gradually becoming thinner and thinner&mdash;losing
her <i lang="fr">enbonpoint</i>&mdash;as she danced; and, worse than that, that
every movement which she described in the figure&mdash;the ladies’
chain, the chassee&mdash;was accurately marked&mdash;recorded&mdash;on
the chalked floor with&mdash;bran! Oh dear! reader, pity me:
was ever man so unfortunate? This sealed my doom. She
would never speak to me, or even look at me afterwards.</p>

<p>But this was not all. My character with the sex&mdash;ay, with
both sexes&mdash;was also destroyed. I who had been heretofore,
as I said, considered as an example of prudence and discretion
for a young man, was now set down as a thoughtless,
devil-may-care wag, never to do well: the men treated me
coldly, and the women turned their backs upon me; and so thus
in reality they made me what they had supposed I was. It
was indeed no wonder, for I could never after see a lady with
a bustle but I felt an irresistible inclination to laughter, and
this too even on occasions when I should have kept a grave
countenance. If I met a couple of country or other friends in
the street, and inquired after their family&mdash;the cause, perhaps,
of the mourning in which they were attired&mdash;while they were
telling me of the death of some father, sister, or other relative,
I to their astonishment would take to laughing, and if
there was a horse near us, give the lady a drag away to another
situation. And if then I were asked the meaning of this
ill-timed mirth, and this singular movement, what could I
say? Why, sometimes I made the matter worse by replying,
“Dear madam, it is only to save your bustle from the horse!”</p>

<p>Stung at length by my misfortunes and the hopelessness of
my situation, I became utterly reckless, and only thought of
carrying out my revenge on the bustles in every way in my
power; and this I must say with some pride I did for a while
with good effect. I got a number of the hated articles manufactured
for myself, but not, reader, to wear, as you shall
hear. Oh! no; but whenever I received an invitation to a
party&mdash;which indeed had latterly been seldom sent me&mdash;I
took one of these articles in my pocket, and, watching a favourable
opportunity when all were engaged in the mazy
figure of the dance, let it secretly fall amongst them. The
result may be imagined&mdash;ay, reader, imagine it, for I cannot
describe it with effect. First, the half-suppressed but simultaneous
scream of all the ladies as it was held up for a
claimant; next, the equally simultaneous movement of the
ladies’ hands, all quickly disengaged from those of their partners,
and not raised up in wonder, but carried down to their&mdash;bustles!
Never was movement in the dance executed with
such precision; and I should be immortalised as the inventor
of an attitude so expressive of sentiment and of <em>feeling</em>.</p>

<p>Alas! this is the only consolation now afforded me in my
afflictions: I invented a new attitude&mdash;a new movement in the
quadrille: let others see that it be not forgotten. I am now
a banished man from all refined society: no lady will appear,
where that odious Mr Bustle, as they call me, might possibly
be; and so no one will admit me inside their doors. I have
nothing left me, therefore, but to live out my solitary life,
and vent my execration of bustles in the only place now left
me&mdash;the columns of the Irish Penny Journal.</p>

<h2 class="gap4">THE COMMON OTTER.</h2>

<p>The otter varies in size, some adult specimens measuring no
more than thirty-six inches in length, tail inclusive, while
others, again, are to be found from four and a half to five
feet long. The head of the otter is broad and flat; its muzzle
is broad, rounded, and blunt; its eyes small and of a semi-circular
form; neck extremely thick, nearly as thick as the
body; body long, rounded, and very flexible; legs short and
muscular; feet furnished with five sharp-clawed toes, webbed
to three-quarters of their extent; tail long, muscular, somewhat
flattened, and tapering to its extremity. The colour of
the otter is a deep blackish brown; the sides of the head, the
front of the neck, and sometimes the breast, brownish grey.
The belly is usually, but not invariably, darker than the back;
the fur is short, and of two kinds; the inferior or woolly coat
is exceedingly fine and close; the longer hairs are soft and
glossy, those on the tail rather stiff and bristly. On either
side of the nose, and just below the chin, are two small light-coloured
spots. So much for the appearance of the otter:
now we come to its dwelling. The otter is common to England,
Ireland, and Scotland; a marine variety is also to be met
with, differing from the common only in its superior size and
more furry coat. Some naturalists have set them down as a
different species: I am, however, disposed to regard them as
a variety merely.</p>

<p>The native haunt of the otter is the river-bank, where
amongst the reeds and sedge it forms a deep burrow, in which
it brings forth and rears its young. Its principal food is fish,
which it catches with singular dexterity. It lives almost
wholly in the water, and seldom leaves it except to devour its
prey; on land it does not usually remain long at any one
time, and the slightest alarm is sufficient to cause it to plunge
into the stream. Yet, natural as seems a watery residence to
this creature, its hole is perfectly dry; were it to become
otherwise, it would be quickly abandoned. Its entrance, indeed,
is invariably under water, but its course then points
upwards into the bank, towards the surface of the earth, and
it is even provided with several lodges or apartments at different
heights, into which it may retire in case of floods,
throwing up the earth behind it as it proceeds into the recesses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
of its retreat; and when it has reached the last and
most secure chamber, it opens a small hole in the roof for the
admission of atmospheric air, without which the animal could
not of course exist many minutes; and should the flood rise
so high as to burst into this last place of refuge, the animal
will open a passage through the roof, and venture forth upon
land, rather than remain in a damp and muddy bed. During
severe floods, otters are not unfrequently surprised at some
distance from the water, and taken.</p>

<p>In a wild state the otter is fierce and daring, will make a
determined resistance when attacked by dogs, and being endued
with no inconsiderable strength of jaw, it often punishes
its assailants terribly. I have myself seen it break the fore-leg
of a stout terrier. Otter-hunting was in former times a
favourite amusement even with the nobility, and regular establishments
of otter-hounds were kept. The animal is now become
scarce, and its pursuit is no longer numbered in our list
of sports, unless perhaps in Scotland, where, especially in the
Western Islands, otter-hunting is still extensively practised.</p>

<p>Otters are easily rendered tame, especially if taken young,
and may be taught to follow their master like dogs, and even
to fish for him, cheerfully resigning their prey when taken,
and dashing into the water in search of more. A man named
James Campbell, residing near Inverness, had one which followed
him wherever he went, unless confined, and would answer
to its name. When apprehensive of danger from dogs,
it sought the protection of its master, and would endeavour
to spring into his arms for greater security. It was frequently
employed in catching fish, and would sometimes take
eight or ten salmon in a day. If not prevented, it always attempted
to break the fish behind the fin which is next the tail;
and as soon as one was taken away, it always dived in pursuit
of more. It was equally dexterous at sea-fishing, and
took great numbers of young cod and other fish. When tired
it would refuse to fish any longer, and was then rewarded
with as much food as it could devour. Having satiated its
appetite, it always coiled itself up and went to sleep, no matter
where it was, in which state it was usually carried home.</p>

<p>Brown relates that a person who kept a tame otter taught
it to associate with his dogs, who were on the most friendly
terms with it on all occasions, and that it would follow its
master in company with its canine friends. This person was
in the habit of fishing the river with nets, on which occasions
the otter proved highly useful to him, by going into the water
and driving trout and other fish towards the net. It was
very remarkable that dogs accustomed to otter-hunting were
so far from offering it the least molestation, that they would
not even hunt any other otter while it remained with them;
on which account its owner was forced to part with it.</p>

<p>The otter is of a most affectionate disposition, as may at
once be seen from its anxiety respecting its young. Indeed,
the parental affection of this creature is so powerful that the
female otter will often suffer herself to be killed rather than
desert them. Professor Steller says, “Often have I spared
the lives of the female otters whose young ones I took away.
They expressed their sorrow by crying like human beings,
and following me as I was carrying off their young, while they
called to them for aid with a tone of voice which very much
resembled the crying of children. When I sat down in the
snow, they came quite close to me, and attempted to carry off
their young. On one occasion when I had deprived an otter
of her progeny, I returned to the place eight days after, and
found the female sitting by the river listless and desponding,
who suffered me to kill her on the spot without making any
attempt to escape. On skinning her I found she was quite
wasted away from sorrow for the loss of her young.” This
affection which the otter, while in a state of nature, displays
towards her young, is when in captivity usually transferred
to her master, or perhaps, as in an instance I shall mention
by and bye, to some one or other of his domestic animals. As
an example of the former case I may mention the following:&mdash;A
person named Collins, who lived near Wooler in Northumberland,
had a tame otter, which followed him wherever he
went. He frequently took it to the river to fish for its own
food, and when satisfied it never failed to return to its master.
One day in the absence of Collins, the otter being taken
out to fish by his son, instead of returning as usual, refused to
answer to the accustomed call, and was lost. Collins tried
every means to recover it; and after several days’ search, being
near the place where his son had lost it, and calling its
name, to his very great joy the animal came crawling to his
feet. In the following passage of the “Prædium Rusticum”
of Vaniere, allusion is made to tame otters employed in fishing:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Should chance within this dark recess betray</div>
<div class="verse">The tender young, bear quick the prize away;</div>
<div class="verse">Tamed by thy care the useful brood shall join</div>
<div class="verse">The watery chase, and add their toils to thine;</div>
<div class="verse">From each close lurking hole shall force away,</div>
<div class="verse">And drive within the nets the silver prey;</div>
<div class="verse">As the taught hound the nimble stag subdues,</div>
<div class="verse">And o’er the dewy plain the panting hare pursues.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Mr Macgillivray, in his interesting volume on British Quadrupeds
in the Naturalist’s Library, mentions several instances
of otters having been tamed and employed in fishing. Among
others he relates that a gentleman residing in the Outer Hebrides
had one that supplied itself with food, and regularly
returned to the house. M’Diarmid, in his “Sketches from
Nature,” enumerates many others. One otter belonging to a
poor widow, “when led forth plunged into the Urr, and
brought out all the fish it could find.” Another, kept at Corsbie
House, Wigtonshire, “evinced a great fondness for gooseberries,”
fondled “about her keeper’s feet like a pup or kitten,
and even seemed inclined to salute her cheek, when permitted
to carry her freedoms so far.” A third, belonging to
Mr Montieth of Carstairs, “though he frequently stole away
at night to fish by the pale light of the moon, and associate
with his kindred by the river side, his master of course was
too generous to find any fault with his peculiar mode of spending
his evening hours. In the morning he was always at his
post in the kennel, and no animal understood better the secret
of ‘keeping his own side of the house.’ Indeed his pugnacity
in this respect gave him a great lift in the favour of the gamekeeper,
who talked of his feats wherever he went, and averred
besides, that if the best cur that ever ran ‘only daured to girn’
at his protegé, he would soon ‘mak his teeth meet through
him.’ To mankind, however, he was much more civil, and
allowed himself to be gently lifted by the tail, though he objected
to any interference with his snout, which is probably
with him the seat of honour.”</p>

<p>Mr Glennon, of Suffolk-street, Dublin, informs me that Mr
Murray, gamekeeper to his Grace the Duke of Leinster, has
a tame otter, which enters the water to fish when desired, and
lays whatever he catches with due submission at his master’s
feet. Mr Glennon further observes, that the affection for his
owner which this animal exhibits is equal or even superior to that
of the most faithful dog. The creature follows him wherever
he goes, will suffer him to lift him up by the tail and carry him
under his arm just as good-humouredly as would a dog, will
spring to his knee when he sits at home, and seems in fact
never happy but when in his company. This otter is well
able to take care of himself, and fearlessly repels the impertinent
advances of the dogs: with such, however, as treat him
with fitting respect, he is on excellent terms. Sometimes Mr
Murray will hide himself from this animal, which will immediately,
on being set at liberty, search for him with the
greatest anxiety, running like a terrier dog by the scent. Mr
Glennon assures me that he has frequently seen the animal
thus trace the footsteps of its master for a considerable distance
across several fields, and that too with such precision
as never in any instance to fail of finding him.</p>

<p>I myself had once a tame otter, with a detail of whose habits
and manners I shall now conclude this article. When I first
obtained the animal she was very young, and not more than
sixteen inches in length: young as she was, she was very
fierce, and would bite viciously if any one put his hand near
the nest of straw in which she was kept. As she grew a little
older, however, she became more familiarized to the approaches
of human beings, and would suffer herself to be gently stroked
upon the back or head; when tired of being caressed, she
would growl in a peculiar manner, and presently use her
sharp teeth if the warning to let her alone were not attended
to. In one respect the manners of this animal presented a
striking contrast to the accounts I had read and heard of other
tame individuals. She evinced no particular affection for me;
she grew tame certainly, but her tameness was rather of a
general than of an exclusive character: unlike other wild animals
which I had at different times succeeded in domesticating, this
creature testified no particular gratitude to her master, and
whoever fed her, or set her at liberty, was her favourite for the
time being. She preferred fish to any other diet, and eagerly
devoured all descriptions, whether taken in fresh or salt
water, though she certainly preferred the former. She would
seize the fish between her fore paws, hold it firmly on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
ground, and devour it downwards to the tail, which with the
head the dainty animal rejected. When fish could not be
procured, she would eat, but sparingly, of bread and milk, as
well as the lean of raw meat; fat she could on no account be
prevailed upon to touch.</p>

<p>Towards other animals my otter for a long period maintained
an appearance of perfect indifference. If a dog approached
her suddenly, she would utter a sharp, whistling
noise, and betake herself to some place of safety: if pursued,
she would turn and show fight. If the dog exhibited no symptoms
of hostility, she would presently return to her place at
the fireside, where she would lie basking for hours at a time.</p>

<p>When I first obtained this animal, there was no water sufficiently
near to where I lived in which I could give her an
occasional bath; and being apprehensive, that, if entirely
deprived of an element in which nature had designed her to
pass so considerable a portion of her existence, she would
languish and die, I allowed her a tub as a substitute for her
native river; and in this she plunged and swam with much
apparent delight. It was in this manner that I became acquainted
with the curious fact, that the otter, when passing
along beneath the surface of the water, does not usually
accomplish its object by swimming, but by walking along the
bottom, which it can do as securely and with as much rapidity
as it can run on dry land.</p>

<p>After having had my otter about a year, I changed my
residence to another quarter of the town, and the stream well
known to all who have seen Edinburgh as the “Water of
Leith,” flowed past the rear of the house. The creature being
by this time so tame as to be allowed perfect liberty, I took it
down one evening to the river, and permitted it to disport itself
for the first time since its capture in a deep and open stream.
The animal was delighted with the new and refreshing enjoyment,
and I found that a daily swim in the river greatly conduced
to its health and happiness. I would sometimes walk for
nearly a mile along the bank, and the happy and frolicsome
creature would accompany me by water, and that too so
rapidly that I could not even by very smart walking keep
pace with it. On some occasions it caught small fish, such as
minnows, eels, and occasionally a trout of inconsiderable
size. When it was only a minnow or a small eel which it
caught, it would devour it in the water, putting its head for
that purpose above the surface; when, however, it had made
a trout its prey, it would come to shore, and devour it more
at leisure. I strove very assiduously to train this otter to
fish for me, as I had heard they have sometimes been taught
to do; but I never could succeed in this attempt, nor could I
even prevail upon the animal to give me up at any time the
fish which she had taken: the moment I approached her to do
so, as if suspecting my intention, she would at once take to
the water, and, crossing to the other side of the stream, devour
her prey in security. This difficulty in training I impute to
the animal’s want of an individual affection for me, for it was
not affection, but her own pleasure, which induced her to follow
me down the stream; and she would with equal willingness
follow any other person who happened to release her
from her box. This absence of affection was probably nothing
more than peculiarity of disposition in this individual, there
being numerous instances of a contrary nature upon record.</p>

<p>Although this otter failed to exhibit those affectionate
traits of character which have displayed themselves in other
individuals of her tribe towards the human species, she was
by no means of a cold or unsocial disposition towards some of
my smaller domestic animals. With an Angora cat she soon
after I got her formed a very close friendship, and when in
the house was unhappy when not in the company of her friend.
I had one day an opportunity of witnessing a singular display
of attachment on the part of this otter towards the cat:&mdash;A
little terrier dog attacked the latter as she lay by the fire, and
driving her thence, pursued her under the table, where she
stood on her defence, spitting and setting up her back in
defiance: at this instant the otter entered the apartment, and
no sooner did she perceive what was going on, than she flew
with much fury and bitterness upon the dog, seized him by the
face with her teeth, and would doubtless have inflicted a severe
chastisement upon him, had I not hastened to the rescue, and,
separating the combatants, expelled the terrier from the room.</p>

<p>When permitted to wander in the garden, this otter would
search for grubs, worms, and snails, which she would eat with
much apparent relish, detaching the latter from their shell
with surprising quickness and dexterity. She would likewise
mount upon the chairs at the window, and catch and eat flies&mdash;a
practice which I have not as yet seen recorded in the
natural history of this animal. I had this otter in my possession
nearly two years, and have in the above sketch mentioned
only a few of its most striking peculiarities. Did I not fear
encroaching on space which is perhaps the property of another
contributor, I could have carried its history to a much
greater length.</p>

<span class="smaller">AN AMERICAN NOBLEMAN.</span></h2>

<p>There reached our city, on the morning of the 29th day of
July, and sailed from it on the night of the 31st, the most
<em>remarkable</em> person perhaps by whom our shores have been
lately visited. Were we to second our own feelings, we would
apply a higher epithet to William Lloyd Garrison, but we
have chosen one in which we are persuaded all parties would
agree who partook of his intercourse, however much they
may differ from each other and from him in principle and in
practice. The object of this short paper is to leave on the
pages of our literature some record of an extraordinary individual,
who is a literary man himself, being the editor and
proprietor of a successful newspaper published at Boston in
Massachusetts; but his name may be best recommended to
our readers in connection with that of the well-known George
Thompson, whose eloquence was so powerful an auxiliary to
the unnumbered petitions which at length wrung from our
legislature the just but expensive emancipation of the West
Indian negroes. Community of action and of suffering, as
pleaders for the rights of the black and coloured population of
the United States, has rendered them bosom friends, and
each has a child called after the name of the other. Thompson
is now a denizen of the United Kingdom; but while we
write, Garrison is crossing the broad Atlantic to encounter
new dangers: comparatively safe at home, his life is forfeited
whenever he ventures to pass the moral line of demarcation
which separates the free from the slave states&mdash;forfeited so
surely as there is a rifle in Kentucky or a bowie knife in
Alabama.</p>

<p>We have set Garrison down as “an American nobleman,”
and the “peerage” in which we look for his titles and dignities
is “The Martyr Age of the United States of America,”
by Harriet Martineau&mdash;a writer to whom none will deny the
possession of discrimination, which is all we contend for.
“William Lloyd Garrison is one of God’s nobility&mdash;the head
of the moral aristocracy, whose prerogatives we are contemplating.
It is not only that he is invulnerable to injury&mdash;that he
early got the world under his feet in a way which it would have
made Zeno stroke his beard with a complacency to witness;
but that in his meekness, his sympathies, his self-forgetfulness,
he appears ‘covered all over with the stars and orders’
of the spiritual realm whence he derives his dignities and his
powers. At present he is a marked man wherever he turns.
The faces of his friends brighten when his step is heard: the
people of colour almost kneel to him; and the rest of society
jeers, pelts, and execrates him. Amidst all this, his gladsome
life rolls on, ‘too busy to be anxious, and too loving to be
sad.’ He springs from his bed singing at sunrise: and if
during the day tears should cloud his serenity, they are never
shed for himself. His countenance of steady compassion gives
hope to the oppressed, who look to him as the Jews looked
to Moses. It was this serene countenance, saint-like in its
earnestness and purity, that a man bought at a print-shop,
where it was exposed without a name, and hung up as the
most apostolic face he ever saw. It does not alter the case
that the man took it out of the frame, and hid it when he
found that it was Garrison who had been adorning his
parlour.” And he can be no common man of whom it is
recorded in the work to which we have already alluded, that,
on starting a newspaper for the advocacy of abolition principles,
“Garrison and his friend Knapp, a printer, were ere
long living in a garret, on bread and water, expending all
their spare earnings and time on the publication, and that
when it sold particularly well (says Knapp), we treated
ourselves with a bowl of milk.”&mdash;<cite>The Martyr Age of the
United States of America</cite>, p. 5.</p>

<p>As we are not writing his memoir, we refer such of our
readers as may be curious to inquire further into the subject
to the pamphlet just cited, and to the chapter headed “Garrison,”
in the work on America by the same writer. To one
extraordinary feature of his character, however, we cannot
forbear adverting. He belongs to a society instituted for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
apparently negative purpose of <em>non-resistance</em>, and is therefore
the safest of all antagonists. Buffet as you list the head
and sides of W. L. Garrison, and you receive no buffet in return.
That this is owing to no deficiency of personal courage,
admits of demonstration. Neither the prison into which he
was cast when a mere lad in one state, the price set on his
head in another, nor the tar-kettle to which he would on one
occasion have been dragged but for a stout arm that came to
his rescue, has been able to make Garrison swerve from what
he considers to be his line of duty. Another cause of this
disposition to passive endurance must be sought, and it is
easily found: <em>he is in love</em>&mdash;deeply in love with all mankind.
His principle is to “resist not evil;” and he acts upon it to
the fullest extent. In fact, he appears to be several centuries
in advance of his time, and to live in a millennium of his own
creating.</p>

<p>We shall only add, that the effect which this remarkable man
produced on the minds of those who companied with him while
in Dublin, was of a very peculiar nature. Among these were
persons of various sects and parties, and of all varieties of
temperament, but nearly all seemed to concur in their estimate
of his character. Though many seemed to think that
he carried out the great principle of love to an unnecessary
extent, none seemed able to gainsay his reasonings. Here
and there tears were seen to start, not called forth by any
sublime sentiment or tender emotion to which he had given
words at the moment, but educed as it were by the abstract
contemplation of the image of intense virtue which he represented;
and most agreed in the opinion, that of all individuals
with whom they had ever been acquainted, he was the one of
whom it could be with most justice asserted, that none could
hold much intercourse with him without becoming better. His
Dublin host sailed to Liverpool on Monday evening for the
mere purpose of enjoying his company for three hours more,
which was all the arrangements the Boston steamer would
permit, in which he was to leave Liverpool on Tuesday.</p>

<p>It would be an act of great injustice to close this article
without making some mention of Garrison’s congenial friend
and companion Nathaniel Peabody Rogers of Plymouth, in
New Hampshire, also the editor and proprietor of a newspaper,
of whom, however, we shall only say, that if (as the
phrase goes) <em>anything happened</em> to W. L. Garrison, he is the
man who would be ready to occupy his place in the admiration
and execration of America.</p>

<p class="right">G. D.</p>

<p class="gap4"><span class="smcap">Time.</span>&mdash;Time is the most undefinable yet most paradoxical
of things: the past is gone, the future is not come, and the
present becomes the past even while we attempt to define it,
and, like the flash of the lightning, at once exists and expires.
Time is the measure of all things, but is itself immeasurable,
and the grand discloser of all things, but is itself undisclosed.
Like space, it is incomprehensible, because it has no limit, and
it would be still more so, if it had. It is more in its source
than the Nile, and its termination, than the Niger; and advances
like the slowest tide, but retreats like the swiftest torrent.
It gives wings of lightning to pleasure, but feet of lead
to pain, and lends expectation a curb, but enjoyment a spur.
It robs beauty of her charms, to bestow them on her picture,
and builds a monument to merit, but denies it a house; it is
the transient and deceitful flatterer of falsehood, but the tried
and final friend of truth. Time is the most subtle, yet the
most insatiable of depredators, and by appearing to take nothing,
is permitted to take all, nor can it be satisfied until it
has stolen the world from us, and us from the world. It constantly
flies, yet overcomes all things by flight; and although
it is the present ally, it will be the future conqueror of death.
Time, the cradle of hope, but the grave of ambition, is the
stern corrector of fools, but the salutary counsellor of the wise,
bringing all they dread to the one, and all they desire to the
other; like Cassandra, it warns us with a voice that even the
sages discredit too long, and the silliest believe too late. Wisdom
walks before it, opportunity with it, and repentance behind
it; he that has made it his friend, will have little to fear
from his enemies; but he that has made it his enemy, will have
little to hope from his friends.&mdash;<cite>Burn’s Youthful Piety.</cite></p>

<p class="gap4"><span class="smcap">Diffidence.</span>&mdash;A man gets along faster with a sensible married
woman in hours than with a young girl in whole days.
It is next to impossible to make them talk, or to reach them.
They are like a green walnut: there are half a dozen outer
coats to be pulled off, one by one and slowly, before you reach
the kernel of their characters.</p>

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
